## Apollo: Scalable and Coordinated Scheduling for Cloud-Scale Computing - 2014

### From Abstract
Apollo is a scalable and coordinated scheduling framework, which is used to shcedule computations with millions of tasks efficiently. And it works really well. Apollo is robust, can handle many unexpected **system dynamics** (*maybe it means can deal with many situlation?*)  and use other idle syste resources **gracefully** (*an interesting word*) while supplying guaranteed resources when needed.
